- **VictoriaMetrics**: 1-2 hours with Helm charts, medium complexity
- **AMP**: Minutes to create workspace, minimal complexity  
- **Mimir**: 2-4 months for full production deployment, high complexity

**Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus eliminates operational overhead** entirely. Multi-AZ deployment, automatic scaling, and S3-backed durability (99.999999999%) come built-in. However, this convenience comes with **fixed retention policies** (150 days default, 3 years maximum) and **regional limitations**.

**Grafana Mimir requires significant Kubernetes expertise** with its microservices architecture spanning 7+ components. The operational burden includes managing distributors, ingesters, compactors, store-gateways, and queriers. While this provides maximum flexibility and horizontal scaling capabilities, it demands **2-3 dedicated SREs** for ongoing operations.

**High availability and disaster recovery:**
- VictoriaMetrics: EBS snapshots + S3 backups, ~15 minutes recovery time
- AMP: Built-in multi-AZ replication, transparent failover
- Mimir: Complex but robust with zone-aware replication and S3 object storage backend

**Maintenance and upgrades:**
- VictoriaMetrics: 2-5 minutes downtime for single-node, zero-downtime for cluster
- AMP: Fully managed, no maintenance required
- Mimir: Zero-downtime possible but requires careful orchestration

## Feature comparison shows strong PromQL compatibility

All three solutions provide **100% PromQL compatibility** essential for DevEx teams migrating from existing Prometheus infrastructure. However, they differ significantly in advanced capabilities and integration options.

**Query capabilities:**
